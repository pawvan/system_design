Building a full-fledged web browser rendering engine like **Blink** (which is used by Chromium, Chrome, Edge, and other browsers) is an incredibly complex task that involves deep understanding of various systems and technologies. It requires knowledge of **HTML parsing**, **CSS rendering**, **JavaScript execution**, **layout algorithms**, and many more low-level browser functionalities. However, I can guide you through the **high-level architecture** and key components involved in building such a project, and the steps to create a **basic web engine** (which you can extend over time).

### Understanding the Major Components of a Browser Engine
At a high level, a browser engine like Blink or Gecko consists of several core components:
1. **HTML Parser**: Converts raw HTML into a tree structure (the DOM).
2. **CSS Parser**: Converts CSS into a structure that can be used for styling the DOM.
3. **Layout Engine**: Determines the position and size of elements on the page (called **reflow** or **layout**).
4. **Rendering Engine**: Paints pixels to the screen by applying styles to elements (called **painting**).
5. **JavaScript Engine**: Executes JavaScript code (like V8 for Blink).
6. **Networking Layer**: Manages HTTP requests, responses, and caching.
7. **Event Handling**: Manages user interactions with the page (like clicks, keyboard inputs, etc.).
8. **Graphics Pipeline**: Converts the computed layout to pixels on the screen, often accelerated by the GPU.

To create a Blink-like engine from scratch, you would need to replicate most (if not all) of these parts. Below is a rough outline of the approach to get started.

### Step 1: Project Setup
#### 1.1 Choose the Programming Language
A project like this typically requires a systems programming language like **C++** (which is used for Blink) or **Rust**. These languages provide the necessary performance and low-level memory management for building a browser engine.

You could also prototype in **C** or **Python** for a simpler version of the engine, though it won’t be as performant or scalable as Blink.

#### 1.2 Organize the Project Structure
You should structure your project to separate concerns. Here's an example directory structure:

```
/webengine
  /src
    /core
      - html_parser.cpp
      - css_parser.cpp
      - js_engine.cpp
      - layout_engine.cpp
      - render_engine.cpp
      - network.cpp
    /graphics
      - canvas.cpp
      - paint.cpp
    /ui
      - event_handling.cpp
    - main.cpp
  /include
    - html_parser.h
    - css_parser.h
    - js_engine.h
    - layout_engine.h
    - render_engine.h
    - network.h
  /assets
    - sample_page.html
```

Each component (HTML parsing, CSS, layout, etc.) should be in a separate file or directory, with a modular design that allows easy testing and updates.

---

### Step 2: HTML Parsing
The first thing your engine needs to do is parse HTML to create the **Document Object Model (DOM)**. This involves:

- Tokenizing the HTML input (converting raw HTML into tokens).
- Converting the tokens into nodes and building a tree structure.
  
Here’s a basic idea of the HTML parser:

#### HTML Parsing (Lexer and Parser):
```cpp
// html_parser.cpp
#include "html_parser.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>

enum class TokenType { TAG_OPEN, TAG_CLOSE, TEXT, ATTRIBUTE, EOF_TOKEN };

struct Token {
    TokenType type;
    std::string value;
};

std::vector<Token> tokenize(const std::string& html) {
    std::vector<Token> tokens;
    // Tokenize HTML string into tokens (tags, text, etc.)
    // This is a simplified lexer; a real lexer will be more complex
    return tokens;
}

Node* parseTokensToDOM(std::vector<Token>& tokens) {
    Node* root = new Node();
    std::vector<Node*> stack;
    stack.push_back(root);

    for (const auto& token : tokens) {
        if (token.type == TokenType::TAG_OPEN) {
            Node* newNode = new Node();
            newNode->tag = token.value;
            stack.back()->children.push_back(newNode);
            stack.push_back(newNode);
        } else if (token.type == TokenType::TAG_CLOSE) {
            stack.pop_back();  // Close current node and pop the stack
        } else if (token.type == TokenType::TEXT) {
            Node* textNode = new Node();
            textNode->text = token.value;
            stack.back()->children.push_back(textNode);
        }
    }

    return root;
}
```

- **Lexer**: A simple lexer breaks down the HTML into tokens (tags, attributes, text).
- **Parser**: A parser converts those tokens into a DOM tree structure.

---

### Step 3: CSS Parsing and Styling
Next, you need to handle **CSS**. The CSS parser will take CSS input and convert it into a structure that can be applied to the DOM. This involves:

- Parsing CSS into a format (CSSOM).
- Matching elements to CSS rules and applying styles.

#### CSS Parsing:
```cpp
// css_parser.cpp
#include "css_parser.h"
#include <vector>
#include <string>

struct Rule {
    std::string selector;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> properties;
};

std::vector<Rule> parseCSS(const std::string& css) {
    std::vector<Rule> rules;
    // Parse CSS string into a set of CSS rules
    return rules;
}

void applyStyles(Node* dom, const std::vector<Rule>& rules) {
    // Loop through each DOM node and apply the relevant styles
}
```

The **CSS Object Model (CSSOM)** represents the parsed CSS rules, which are then applied to the DOM nodes during the layout process.

---

### Step 4: Layout (Reflow)
The layout engine is responsible for calculating the size and position of each element on the screen based on the **DOM** and **CSS**.

- **Layout** calculates the position and size of each element.
- Use the **Box Model** (padding, margin, borders, content) to calculate these properties.

#### Simple Layout Engine:
```cpp
// layout_engine.cpp
#include "layout_engine.h"

void layoutNode(Node* node, float x, float y) {
    // Calculate position based on the parent node's coordinates
    // For simplicity, you can start with just width/height
    if (node->type == NodeType::ELEMENT) {
        // Set position and size based on CSS styles
        node->style.x = x;
        node->style.y = y;
    }

    // Recursively layout child nodes
    for (auto& child : node->children) {
        layoutNode(child, x + 10, y + 10);  // Simple offset for children
    }
}
```

The **layout engine** will recursively calculate the positions and sizes of elements, using the parent-child relationships in the DOM.

---

### Step 5: Rendering (Painting)
After layout, you need to **paint** the page, which means converting the layout into actual pixel data.

- Apply colors, borders, and text.
- For simplicity, you can use a graphics library like **Cairo** or **Skia** to draw pixels.

#### Simple Rendering (Painting):
```cpp
// render_engine.cpp
#include "render_engine.h"
#include <cairo.h>

void renderNodeToCanvas(Node* node, cairo_t* cr) {
    if (node->type == NodeType::ELEMENT) {
        // Draw a rectangle or image based on the node's dimensions and style
        cairo_rectangle(cr, node->style.x, node->style.y, node->style.width, node->style.height);
        cairo_set_source_rgb(cr, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);  // Blue color
        cairo_fill(cr);
    }

    // Recursively paint children
    for (auto& child : node->children) {
        renderNodeToCanvas(child, cr);
    }
}
```

Here, we use the **Cairo graphics library** to draw elements on a canvas. For full-scale projects, browsers optimize this with GPU-accelerated rendering (via WebGL, OpenGL, or DirectX).

---

### Step 6: JavaScript Engine
Implementing a basic JavaScript engine is highly complex, but you can start by integrating an existing engine like **V8** or **QuickJS** (a lightweight JavaScript engine).

For integrating V8, you'd need to:
- Embed V8 into your engine.
- Hook V8's garbage collection and execution pipeline into your web engine.

---

### Step 7: Event Handling and User Interaction
Handle basic events like `click`, `keypress`, `resize`, etc., by adding event listeners to DOM elements and dispatching events to those elements when the user interacts with the page.

---

### Step 8: Networking and Fetching Resources
Implement a basic HTTP client to fetch HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources (images, fonts, etc.) from the network.

- **Networking Layer**: Use `libcurl` (C++) or `requests` (Python) to fetch resources.
- Parse and apply external resources (CSS, JS, images) in the context of your engine.

---

### Final Thoughts: Scaling to Blink-Like Functionality
The above steps outline how to build a **basic web engine** from scratch. Creating a full-fledged **Blink-like engine** involves deep optimizations in each of these areas, handling things like:

- **GPU acceleration for rendering**

.
- **Multithreading** (for JS execution, rendering, etc.).
- **Web APIs** (localStorage, IndexedDB, Fetch API, etc.).
- **JavaScript execution engine** (with garbage collection, optimization, etc.).
- **Security** (sandboxing, content security policy).

A project like Blink is maintained by a **large community** of engineers and includes optimizations for every aspect of browser performance and security. However, starting with a basic engine and iterating on it will provide you with a solid understanding of how browsers work under the hood!
